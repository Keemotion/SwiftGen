## Important: ⚠️ Refactoring in progress ⚠️ 

SwiftGen has arrived to a point where it's big enough to deserve [its own GitHub organization](https://github.com/SwiftGen/), and will also be split into multiple repositories for better structure and flexibility.

This means that SwiftGen's code will be subject to a big reorganizaton (see [#240](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/issues/240)) and that it may not be the best time to submit a new PR, as it will likely not be valid anymore after that refactoring.

We still welcome new PRs very much of course, and are really glad you wish to contribute! But if your change is likely to be affected by this big reorganization, it might be easier for you to wait a few weeks until that refactoring is finished (It's not expected to last long — we hope to finish that big migration ASAP) before submitting your changes, to avoid doing the work twice.
